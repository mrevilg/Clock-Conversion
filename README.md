# Clock-Conversion
Challenge - Convert 24hr user input to 12hr clock

You prefer a good old 12-hour time format. But the modern world we live in would rather use the 24-hour format and you see it everywhere. Your task is to convert the time from the 24-h format into 12-h format by following the next rules:

- the output format should be 'hh:mm a.m.' (for hours before midday) or 'hh:mm p.m.' (for hours after midday)

- if hours is less than 10 - don't write a '0' before it. For example: '9:05 a.m.'

1. ClockDict - File using hashtable/dictionary brute force approach
